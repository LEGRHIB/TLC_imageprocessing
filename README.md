# TLC_imageprocessing
This project automates TLC analysis by capturing and processing TLC plate images, saving time and improving accuracy. We utilize image recognition techniques to measure distances on TLC plates and automatically store the data in an MES.
# Project Description
This project aims to automate the TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography) process by enhancing image capture and data analysis. The primary goal is to reduce manual tasks, improve accuracy, and streamline the workflow by automating key steps, including capturing TLC images under UV light, measuring the distance of sample spots, and storing results in a Manufacturing Execution System (MES). We aim to create a system that is efficient and reliable for lab environments.
# Steps:
# 1-Image Capture:

Capture TLC images under normal light and UV light using a camera setup.
# 2-TLC Plate Detection:
Detect six TLC plates in each image and segment them for further analysis.

# 3-Baseline and Solvent Front Detection:
Identify and mark the baseline and the solvent front line on each TLC plate.

# 4-Distance Measurement:
Measure distances from the baseline to the solvent front and from the baseline to the sample spots on each plate.

# 5-UV Light Detection:
Detect and highlight sample spots visible under UV light.

# 6-Data Storage:
Automatically save the processed results (spot measurements, distances from baseline and solvent front, etc.) in the Manufacturing Execution System (MES).
# 7-User Interface:
Implement a simple interface for users to upload images and view processed results.

# 8-Automation and Integration:
Integrate the system with the lab's current workflow, ensuring compatibility with existing MES.
